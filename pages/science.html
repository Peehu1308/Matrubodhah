        <!-- <h2>Exploring India’s Traditional Art Forms</h2>     -->
        <p>India’s ancient traditions are deeply rooted in scientific principles, blending practical wisdom with cultural beliefs. Many traditional practices, from Ayurveda to astronomy, have a strong scientific foundation and continue to inspire modern research. This journey will help children explore the scientific knowledge behind India's heritage and understand its relevance in today’s world.
        </p>
            <h2 >Ayurveda – The Science of Life</h2>
            
            Ayurveda, India’s ancient medical system, focuses on holistic health, balancing the body, mind, and spirit.

Scientific Basis:
Doshas (Body Constitution): Ayurveda classifies individuals into three doshas – Vata (air), Pitta (fire), and Kapha (earth & water), similar to modern concepts of body types and metabolic functions.
Herbal Medicine: Many Ayurvedic herbs, such as turmeric and neem, have been scientifically proven to have medicinal properties.
Detoxification: Panchakarma, an Ayurvedic detox therapy, helps remove toxins from the body and improve health.
            
            <h2>Yoga – The Science of Mind and Body</h2>
            <p>
                Yoga is not just a physical exercise; it is a scientific practice that enhances mental and physical well-being.

Scientific Basis:
Postures and Flexibility: Yoga improves posture, flexibility, and muscle strength.
Breathing Techniques (Pranayama): Controlled breathing helps reduce stress and increase oxygen supply to the brain.
Meditation and Neuroscience: Studies show that meditation enhances brain function, improves focus, and reduces anxiety.
            </p>
            <h2>Ancient Indian Mathematics – The Foundation of Numbers</h2>
            <p>
                India has made significant contributions to mathematics, many of which are still used today.

Scientific Basis:
Zero and Decimal System: The concept of zero, introduced by Indian mathematicians like Aryabhata and Brahmagupta, revolutionized mathematics.
Geometry and Architecture: Ancient temples and structures were designed using precise mathematical calculations.
Vedic Mathematics: A mental calculation system that simplifies complex arithmetic, making math faster and more intuitive.
            </p>
            <h2>Astronomy – Mapping the Universe</h2>
            <p>Ancient Indian astronomers made groundbreaking discoveries about the universe, many of which align with modern science.

                Scientific Basis:
                Heliocentric Theory: Aryabhata proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis, long before Western scientists confirmed it.
                Eclipses and Planetary Movements: Indian astronomers accurately predicted solar and lunar eclipses.
                The Concept of Infinity: Indian mathematicians explored the idea of infinity and its role in the cosmos.
                </p>
            <h2>Metallurgy – Advanced Engineering in Ancient India</h2>
            <p>
                India was home to some of the most advanced metallurgical techniques in ancient times.

Scientific Basis:
Iron Pillar of Delhi: A rust-resistant iron structure, showcasing India’s expertise in metallurgy.
Wootz Steel: An ancient Indian steel-making technique that laid the foundation for modern steel production.
Temple Bells and Resonance: Indian temple bells are designed to produce specific sound frequencies that enhance mental clarity.
            </p>
            <h2>Water Conservation – Traditional Wisdom for Sustainability</h2>
            <p>Ancient India had innovative water conservation techniques that are still relevant today.

                Scientific Basis:
                Stepwells and Rainwater Harvesting: Ingenious designs that stored and purified water naturally.
                Sacred Rivers and Ecosystem Balance: Scientific understanding of how rivers support biodiversity and sustain civilizations.
                Clay Pots and Cooling Science: The natural cooling effect of clay pots follows the principle of evaporation.
